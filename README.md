# Classifier decision boundary

This repository contains a code for plotting the decision boundary of a 2D binary classifier, implemented by a shallow neural network with arbitrary number of hidden neurons. The main code can be found in the notebook `decisionBoundary.ipynb`, while the model and the visualizer are impemented `functions.py`. The simulation produces a GIF animation, showing different levels of network expressivity with increasing network complexity. Dependencies: `tensorflow 2.18.0` and `keras 3.8.0`.
